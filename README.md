# Public_Projects - Example
Let's say you have a fancy new paper and you want to share the scripts you used to do those cool analyses with the world (or just with the lab, depending on your privacy settings).Here is the place for that.

## Steps
1. Create a repository and make the settings public or private.
2. Upload your nice (or maybe rough) scripts to the repository.
3. Write a short 'README.md' file to describe what each script does, what the project was, and where people can find the paper and/or data.

   * You cannot store EEG data on github.
